This project is being developed by me to study web HTTP protocol and related knowledge, aiming for a complete understanding of the field.
The focus of this project is more on server code rather than client code, with an emphasis on handling some post and get requests, as well as providing necessary resources for server operation, which can be referred to in the sample code.
However, since it is still in the development stage, there may be various issues such as optimization, convenience, and security. Please note that unpredictable events can occur when using this project.

If you are interested in this project, please feel free to contact me.
